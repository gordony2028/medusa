In this chapter, you'll learn how to set a limit on the number of times a scheduled job is executed.

## Default Number of Scheduled Job Executions

By default, a scheduled job is executed whenever it matches its specified pattern. For example, if you set a scheduled job to run every five minutes, it will run every five minutes until you stop the Medusa application.

## Configure Number of Scheduled Job Executions

To execute a scheduled job a specific number of times only, you can configure it with the `numberOfExecutions` option. Its value is the number of times the scheduled job can be executed during the Medusa application's runtime.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["9", "numberOfExecutions", "The number of times the job should be executed."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
export default async function myCustomJob() {
  console.log("I'll be executed only three times.")
}

export const config = {
  name: "hello-world",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
  numberOfExecutions: 3,
}
```

The above scheduled job has the `numberOfExecutions` configuration set to `3`.

So, Medusa will execute this job only 3 times, once every minute, and then it won't be executed anymore during the current runtime.

### Configuration is Per Application Runtime

Medusa tracks the number of executions for a scheduled job during its current runtime. Once the application stops, the next time you start it, the counter will be reset to `0`.

So, if you restart the Medusa application, the scheduled job will be executed again until it reaches the number of executions specified.
